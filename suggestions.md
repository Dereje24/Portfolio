Fantastic work!  Your website has met and surpassed all of the requirements!  Your javascript is clean and well commented.  Your CSS rules are very well organized and show a lot of thought went into them.  Your HTML utilizes semantic code to it's maximum ability.  I really can't think of any areas that would require any rework. A fantastic first project!
