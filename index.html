The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Surround yourself with angels</p>

		<p>The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed.</p>
		<p>The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. They don’t want us to eat. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it.</p>
